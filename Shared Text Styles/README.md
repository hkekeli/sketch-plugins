## Features
Shared Text Styles currently let's you import and export text styles through a .json file. More features coming soon!

### Export text styles
To create a consistent typographic style throughout your project, it's a good idea to create an overview of the Text Styles you're going to use in your project.

When you defined your Text Styles, simply go to your Plugins → Shared Text Styles → Export Text Styles..., to export your Text Styles to a .json file. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `cmd + alt + e`.

### Import text styles
When you've exported your Text Styles, you can import them into any Sketch document, so the typography is consistent.

Go to your Plugins → Shared Text Styles → Import Text Styles..., to import the Text Styles. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `cmd + alt + n`.

### Re-Import text styles
Typography is never done and changes quite a lot. Shared Text Styles let's you re-import Text Styles that overwrite their initial states, so you can keep on iterating.

Go to your Plugins → Shared Text Styles → Import Text Styles..., to re-import the Text Styles. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `cmd + alt + n`.
