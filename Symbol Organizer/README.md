Organize your symbols page alphabetically (including layer list) and into groupings determined by your symbol names. Also provides the ability to choose the granularity of the groups, layout symbols horizontally or vertically, set a maximum of symbols per row/column, reverse the layer list sort direction, sequentially rename duplicate symbols, gather symbols from other pages, and to remove any unused symbols (will ignore nested symbols, symbols with nested symbols, symbols used as overrides, or symbols that reside on other pages).
